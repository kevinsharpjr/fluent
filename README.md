Fluent provides a semantic domain-specific language that can be used to construct a fluent interface for test execution libraries.

See the [Fluent wiki](https://github.com/jnyman/fluent/wiki) for details on how to use the framework.

Installation
------------

Generally you will just install Fluent as a gem:

    $ gem install fluent

If your application uses a Gemfile, add the following line to it:

    gem 'fluent'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

4. Create unit tests (in spec) for your changes.
5. Commit your changes.
6. Push to the branch.
